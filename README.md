## Description

Ignite is a decentralized social network, which allows everyone to share her/his mind freely via texts and media files. 
All the posts are distributed through Ethereum blockchain and stored immutable in Distributed Data Storage (our current version of DDS uses [Soter](https://gitlab.com/btfs_ignite)).

## How to test

Testing of the current functionality of Ignite can be performed via User Interface implemented in Ignite [front-end](https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/ignite-front-end) repo.

## How it works

Ignite is a decentralized microblogging service powered by Bittorrent and public blockchain. In its essence, Ignite represents a set of independent and equitable nodes.Main features of Ignite : 

1.	It can not be blocked by any form of barrier or firewall, because it uses: 
 - BTFS engine stores ALL of its stuff and nobody can block BTT really effectively yet.
 - We use Ethereum blockchain to authenticate users and nodes and nobody can block it too! 
 - Authentication is done through blockchain;
 
2.	Ignite is Immutable: data is stored forever on a distributed data storage BTFS/SOTER;

3.	Community driven: no centralized administration or governance.

All the posts texts and media attached to them are stored in the Distributed Data Storage (DDS). DDS is secure file storage for able to store necessary data and media for a period of 10-100 years. This ensures information immutability and censorship resistance. Our current version of DDS uses [Soter](https://gitlab.com/btfs_ignite). It stores all data we need to exchange between nodes. 

```
Note: speed of DDS files retrieval is far lower than what is needed to implement smooth UX. 
```
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used to resolve this issue. It is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. Its goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users. CND basically serves as a cache that is synched with DDS (which can be considered as an immutable backup in this scheme). 

To make CDN censorship-resistant as well, we use [Skynet](https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-bdf0209d6d34) (CDN presented by Sia).
Due to the blockchain nature of Ignite, authentication is done through a PROM crypto wallet (ERC20). 

## How to run

> Outdated documentation. Need to update. Now running in Docker Compose requires more configuration of depended services and networks.

### Prerequisites

In order to run Ignite, you have to install:
- Docker. You can find installation instructions on [official website](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Docker-compose, which can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Build and run process

Firstly, you need to clone this repository with the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/ignite-back-end.git```

#### Running inside Docker

In order to run Ignite node inside Docker container, you need to do the following:

- Create`.env` file in project's **root** directory and configure environmental variables. It is required to configure environmental 
variables to run the application. You can find their description [below](#environmental-variables).
- While in project directory, run the following command:

```docker-compose up --build``` or ```docker-compose up --build -d``` if you want to run the application in detached mode.
